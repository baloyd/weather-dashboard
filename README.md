# weather-dashboard
In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a weather dashboard that displays weather forecasts for cities searched by the user. 
The information is dynamically generated in the respective containers and includes a 5-day forecast.
The uv index's color changes depending on the value of the index to indicate whether it is favorable(green), moderate(orange) or severe(red).
By clicking on the city in the search history, you can recall the information back into their respective containers even after searching for a new city.
